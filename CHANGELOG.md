# Changelog

All notable changes to the PerSpec Testing Framework will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added — Unity Helper toolbox expansion
- **16 new scene actions** in `SceneTaskExecutor` (43 total): `WrapWithParent`, `AddComponentToMatching`, `Validate`, `BatchSetProperty`, `ApplyRecipe`, `SetActive`, `SetSiblingIndex`, `DuplicateGameObject`, `MoveGameObject`, `RemoveComponent`, `GetProperty`, `FindObjects`, `SetPropertyOnMatching`, `ClosePrefab`, `RemoveMissingScripts`, `ReportMissingScripts`. Switch dispatch retains both `SetParent` and `SetParentByTransform`.
- **`FindInActiveContext`** scene+prefab-aware lookup replacing 50× call sites that used bare `GameObject.Find`. Actions now work uniformly inside the active scene and inside Prefab Mode.
- **List-property variants** (`SetListPropertyOnPrefab` / `OnSceneFile` / `OnGameObject` / `OnScriptableObject`) for cleaner dispatch and prefab-stage tracking.
- **JSON Schemas** in `Editor/Schemas/` (`scenario.schema.json`, `recipe.schema.json`, `validator-rules.schema.json`) for editor autocomplete and pre-execution validation.
- **`unityhelper_coordinator.py`** runs Draft-07 schema validation against `scenario.schema.json` before submission. Falls back gracefully if `jsonschema` is not installed; bypassable with `--skip-schema-validation`.
- **`TmproTaskExecutor`** with 4 TextMeshPro-specific actions, and **`Runtime/Localization/ArabicShaper.cs`** for Arabic text shaping.
- **Async-task plumbing**: `TaskExecutorRegistry.IsAsyncTask(task)` exposed for non-UI coordinators; `ScenarioExecutorCoordinator` drives execution via a per-frame state machine that honors async tasks.
- **`LocalizationTaskExecutor`** expanded with additional actions.

### Added — Missing-script handling on prefabs
- **`OpenPrefab`** now scans the opened stage for GameObjects with missing `MonoBehaviour` script slots. Detection uses `GameObjectUtility.GetMonoBehavioursWithMissingScriptCount` plus `AssetDatabase.GetDependencies` + `MonoScript.GetClass()` for class-load failures (no `.prefab` text parsing). When found, the task **succeeds with a `WARNING:`-prefixed `task.result`** and a `Debug.LogWarning` listing affected GameObject paths and the resolvable broken-script paths.
- **`SavePrefab`** runs the same scan as a pre-flight; if missing slots exist, the task **fails** with an actionable error listing affected paths and broken script references, replacing Unity's opaque generic save error.
- **`RemoveMissingScripts`** new action — strips missing-script slots from the open prefab (or a scoped sub-target via `target` param) so `SavePrefab` can succeed afterward. Uses `GameObjectUtility.RemoveMonoBehavioursWithMissingScript`.
- **`ReportMissingScripts`** new diagnostic action — reports missing-script GameObjects + resolvable dependency GUIDs for a prefab via Unity APIs only (`PrefabUtility.LoadPrefabContents`, `EditorJsonUtility.ToJson`, `AssetDatabase`). Documents that orphan GUIDs (where both `.cs` and `.meta` were deleted) are not retrievable through Unity APIs and require git history (`git log --all --diff-filter=D`).

### Documentation
- `Documentation/unity-helper-tasks.md` (1219 lines): documented every dispatched scene action — 43 scene + 17 localization sections, plus the `Validate hasComponent` extension.
- `Documentation/LLM.md`: added "Unity Helper — Augmented Toolbox" section with explicit pre-flight instructions for AI agents to load the action catalogue and JSON Schemas before authoring scenarios/recipes/validator-rules.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added
- **`no_match`: a filter that matches nothing is now its own terminal status**
  - `inconclusive` used to mean three unrelated things at once: tests ran and were all
    skipped, compilation errors blocked the run, and *the filter named something that does
    not exist*. Only the third is a caller mistake, and collapsing it with the other two hid
    the one thing the caller could actually fix. The reported symptom was a wrong namespace
    submitted three times in a row, because "inconclusive" reads as "flaky, run it again".
  - A request whose filter resolves to zero tests now ends as `no_match`, with an
    `error_message` naming the filter. `inconclusive` keeps its honest meaning: the run
    produced no usable evidence either way.
- **The filter is resolved BEFORE PlayMode is entered**
  - New `TestFilterPreflight` walks Unity's test tree via `TestRunnerApi.RetrieveTestList`
    and answers "does this filter select anything?" without starting a run. The reported case
    now fails in about a second and never enters PlayMode, instead of costing a full cycle.
  - Covers `class`, `method` **and** `category`. Categories can be judged properly here for
    the first time: per-test categories exist in the test tree but not in the NUnit results
    XML, so the after-the-fact verifier could only ever report them as unverifiable.
  - Governing rule: a pre-flight that cannot answer returns "could not verify" and lets the
    run proceed. An empty test tree, a null callback, a 30s watchdog expiry, a malformed
    category regex, or an explicitly parenthesised filter all fall back to exactly the
    behaviour that shipped before. A false `no_match` would send a caller to rename a class
    that was fine - the same failure inverted - so uncertainty never blocks a run.
- **Near-miss suggestions now catch a wrong namespace, not just a missing one**
  - `TestResultVerifier.SuggestQualifiedName` gained a second pass matching on the last
    segment, so `TestProj.Modules.Tests.WidgetAlignerTests` now suggests
    `TestProj.Core.Tests.WidgetAlignerTests`. The old single pass only handled an
    omitted prefix, so for the reported bug it produced no suggestion at all.
  - `+` counts as a segment boundary, so a dotted nested-class filter is answered with the
    real `Outer+Inner` spelling.
- **Exit code 6 from `quick_test.py`** for `no_match`, so a caller can tell "you typed the
  name wrong" apart from "the tests are red" (1) and stop retrying.
- **`test_results.py` now names the run it is showing**
  - `latest` and `show` print a `Contains:` line - the number of test-cases and the
    distinct classes they belong to - and `list` prints the same digest under every file.
    Derived from the `<test-case fullname>` entries, which are the only ground truth about
    whose run a file is. The root counts and the file mtime cannot tell one run's output
    from another's.
  - The `Timestamp:` line now says `(file mtime, not from the XML)`, which is what it has
    always silently been.
- **`test_results.py latest --for-request <id>`**
  - Reads the request from the coordination database, derives the window in which its
    results could possibly have been written (`started_at ?? created_at`, minus a 5s
    clock-skew buffer - the same ladder the C# side uses), and refuses to print anything it
    cannot attribute to that request.
  - When the request never finished it exits **5** and prints nothing from any file. This is
    the reported case: `--wait` timed out, the row was still `processing`, and `latest`
    happily showed the previous class's green run.
  - When the request finished but nothing on disk contains its tests, it exits **3** (or 1
    for a non-`completed` row), naming the classes the candidate files actually hold and,
    where it can, the fully qualified filter the caller probably meant.
  - Prints the candidate ledger - every file considered and why it was rejected.
  - Scores the **matched subset** rather than the file's totals, so `--allow-partial` cannot
    report a broader run's failures as this request's.
  - Under `--json`, `results` is `null` whenever the outcome is not `ok`, so a scripted
    caller is physically unable to read another run's counts.
- **`test_results.py latest --newer-than <when>`** - a relative age (`15m`, `2h`, `1d`),
  epoch seconds, or ISO 8601. Exits non-zero when nothing has been written in that window.
- **Stuck-run watchdog (`TestCoordinatorEditor.TickWatchdog`)**
  - Guarantees no test request stays non-terminal indefinitely. Sweeps every 30s, driven
    both from `EditorApplication.update` and from `BackgroundPoller`'s threading timer, so
    it keeps ticking while the editor is unfocused.
  - Recovers first and times out last: a run whose completion checker never fired may have
    written a perfectly good XML that nobody adopted, so the same content-verified recovery
    ladder runs before any `timeout` is written.
  - Ceiling is `TestExecutor`'s own ceiling plus a 300s grace (600s batch, 900s single
    method), deliberately above both the in-process monitor and Python's `--timeout`, so the
    more precise in-process result always wins when one is possible.
  - Prefs: `PerSpec_Watchdog_Enabled`, `PerSpec_Watchdog_TimeoutSeconds` (0 = auto),
    `PerSpec_Watchdog_StopPlayMode` (off by default).

### Changed
- **The after-the-run zero-match paths report `no_match` too**
  - `TestExecutor.DescribeFilterMismatch`, `PlayModeTestCompletionChecker`, orphan recovery,
    and the Python `print_summary` downgrade now all distinguish "tests ran and not one was
    this filter's" (`no_match`) from "nothing ran at all" (`inconclusive`). One status means
    one thing wherever it is written.
- **`no_match` never adopts a results file**
  - No test ran, so no XML can belong to the request. The client no longer waits out the XML
    grace period for one, and no longer prints a verification line about some other run's
    file - the same "stale green" hazard that made the original typo take four attempts to
    find.
- **The Control Center's "Run Pending Tests" uses the real dispatcher**
  - `TestCoordinationService` carried a parallel implementation with its own run-state flags
    and its own filter builder that always used `testNames` - which a class name can never
    match, so a class dispatched from the Control Center silently ran nothing. It also
    skipped the `"Both"` platform rejection and could start a run while the coordinator
    believed none was active. It now forwards to `TestCoordinatorEditor.ProcessTestRequest`.
- **`quick_test.py --wait` exits 5 on a timeout**, no longer 1, and says explicitly that NO
  results were produced for the request, that it is still in status X, and that
  `test_results.py latest` will therefore show an OLDER run. Points at
  `latest --for-request <id>` and `stuck --repair`. Exit 1 no longer means "or timed out".
- **Orphan recovery searches `PerSpec/TestResults` too, and anchors on `started_at`**
  - It previously probed only Unity's AppData copy and measured age from `created_at`, which
    is when Python inserted the row - arbitrarily earlier than dispatch when the request
    queued behind a compile. It now shares one decision ladder with the watchdog
    (`FinalizeStuckRequest`), differing only in its verdict: `failed` for "the editor
    restarted and the run is gone", `timeout` for "it may still be alive but blew its
    ceiling".

### Fixed
- **Terminal rows that were never cleaned up**
  - `SQLiteManager` and `quick_clean.py` deleted only `completed`/`failed`/`cancelled` rows,
    so every `timeout` and `inconclusive` request accumulated forever. All terminal statuses
    are now listed in both.
- **`Cancelled test request -1`**
  - The Control Center's cancel logged the request id after clearing it, so it always named
    `-1`.
- **A PlayMode run that hung could stay `processing` forever**
  - `TestExecutor`'s `MAX_WAIT_TIME` monitor lives on `EditorApplication.update` inside an
    object the enter-PlayMode domain reload destroys, so `HandleTestTimeout` can never fire
    for a PlayMode run. `PlayModeTestCompletionChecker` only acts on `EnteredEditMode`. And
    `RecoverOrphanedRequests` ran **only from the `[InitializeOnLoad]` static constructor** -
    that is, only on a domain reload, which a run wedged inside play mode never triggers.
  - Between them, nothing was watching. The row stayed non-terminal, `--wait` gave up at its
    client-side timeout, and orphan recovery never saw the request at all.
- **A wedged run could disable testing for the rest of the editor session**
  - `_isRunningTests` stayed `true` for the stuck request, and it is the first guard in
    `TryDispatchNextRequest`, so every later request was silently refused. The watchdog now
    tears the local run down - but only for a request this session actually owns.
- **`timeout` and `inconclusive` rows had a NULL `completed_at`**
  - `UpdateStatusBase` stamped `CompletedAt` only for `completed|failed|cancelled`, yet
    `RecoverOrphanedRequests` really does call `UpdateRequestStatus(id, "inconclusive", ...)`.
    Any reader keying off that column saw a finished request as still running.
- **`test_results.py failed` listed every failure once per failure**
  - `all_failed.extend(failed)` sat inside the loop that stamped each test, so a file with
    four failures printed all four of them four times.
- **`ResolveDispatchTime` read the SessionState dispatch stamp for any request**
  - The stamp describes whichever request is currently marked in-flight. Harmless for its
    one original caller, wrong the moment a sweep over many rows reuses it. Renamed
    `ResolveRunAnchor` and now checks the marker names the request being asked about.

### Upgrade notes
- Existing databases migrate themselves: Unity self-heals the `status` CHECK constraint on
  load (`DatabaseInitializer`), and `db_auto_maintenance.py` gained an idempotent migration
  v7. To do it by hand, run
  `python PerSpec/Coordination/Scripts/db_update_status_constraint.py`.
- If a database still rejects `no_match`, both the C# and the Python writer detect the
  rejected write and fall back to `inconclusive` rather than stranding the row mid-flight.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added
- **Five generalized Unity subagents**
  - `unity-log-triage` (`haiku`) owns `monitor_editmode_logs.py` and `test_playmode_logs.py`
    in all their forms. Returns the distinct errors, their counts, and first occurrence -
    not the log. Knows that PlayMode capture is sampled every 5 seconds, so a missing line
    is not proof an event did not happen.
  - `unity-test-runner` (`haiku`) owns the refresh, verify, run loop. Stops and reports if
    compilation errors exist instead of running anyway, keeps `--timeout` at 300s or above,
    and returns pass/fail **sets** rather than counts so runs can be compared to each other.
  - `unity-scene-inspector` (`sonnet`) owns every scene, prefab, and asset content
    question, answered through `scene_hierarchy.py`. Megabytes of JSON in, one line out.
  - `unity-codebase-scout` (`sonnet`) handles find-usages and find-implementations across a
    large project, and always reports which roots it actually searched.
  - `unity-asmdef-doctor` (`haiku`) diagnoses assembly definition wiring, including the
    signature where a `MenuItem` in a runtime assembly never registers and `quick_menu.py`
    reports that as a timeout rather than as "not found".
- **"Analyze with the export, never by reading YAML" rule in `LLM.md`**
  - The hierarchy export is now documented as the supported way to inspect scene and
    prefab contents. It resolves GUIDs and fileIDs, applies prefab overrides, and honours
    `m_RemovedComponents`, so it reports what the scene actually contains. Reading raw
    `.unity` or `.prefab` YAML burns hundreds of thousands of lines of context for an
    answer the export hands over in one field.
  - Covers scoping the export narrowly, finding the answer with `grep -n` rather than
    `cat`, leaving `--show` off, and what to do when the export genuinely cannot answer.
- **Model tier table in `LLM.md`**
  - Documents when to pick `haiku`, `sonnet`, or `opus`, with relative cache-read cost, so
    tier choice is a recorded decision rather than a default.
- **Standing delegation authorization in `LLM.md`**
  - States plainly that the user has pre-authorized delegation, so a subagent does not need
    to be requested per task. Paired with a positive trigger list and a short "handle inline"
    list.

### Changed
- **Five agents retiered off `opus`**
  - `test-coordination-agent` to `haiku`; `batch-refactor-agent`, `architecture-agent`,
    `test-writer-agent`, and `refactor-agent` to `sonnet`.
  - `dots-performance-profiler` stays on `opus`. Burst and job-dependency analysis is
    genuine reasoning, not volume work.
  - Every tool call re-reads the whole context, so cost tracks context size multiplied by
    call count. Agents pinned to the top tier for mechanical work were paying top-tier cache
    reads for work with no judgment in it.
- **All agent `description:` fields rewritten**
  - Each now leads with an imperative and names its trigger condition
    ("Use PROACTIVELY whenever ..."). The previous passive "Use this agent to ..." phrasing
    is rarely picked by automatic agent selection, so the tier settings were never exercised.
- **`LLM.md` agent section replaced**
  - The "Score 1-3 / 4-7 / 8+" decision matrix, the "When to Use Agents" table with its
    explicit NO rows, and the `Task(...)` pseudo-code examples are gone. They set the bar at
    "complex feature, 5+ files", which almost no daily task clears, so delegation never
    happened.
  - The `Available Agents` list is now a table of all eleven agents with their tier. It
    previously omitted `test-coordination-agent`, which existed as a file the whole time.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added
- **Content verification for every test result file**
  - New `TestResultVerifier` (C#) and `results_verification.py` (Python) answer one question:
    do the `<test-case fullname>` entries in this XML actually belong to the request that is
    about to adopt them? Every path that could mark a request terminal now goes through it.
  - The verdict is three-way rather than a boolean. `Exact` is the healthy outcome for a
    filtered run and is required while a run may still be live. `Partial` means the file is
    from a broader run; it is accepted only at the true end of a run, and reports the matching
    subset rather than the whole file's counts. `None` and `Empty` are never adopted.
  - Category runs report `Unverifiable`: NUnit output carries no category information, so they
    are still accepted on their timestamp, but the row says so instead of implying a match.
  - When an unqualified class name matches nothing, the verifier suggests the fully qualified
    name it found in the results, so the failure is actionable.
- **`quick_test.py` fails fast when the Unity Editor is not responding**
  - Unity writes a heartbeat to `system_status` about once a second. Nothing on the Python
    side ever read it, so a request submitted while the editor was restarting sat in `pending`
    until the full 300-second timeout expired with no explanation.
  - `--wait` now aborts within seconds with `UnityNotRespondingError` and exit code **4**, and
    a warning is printed up front if the editor is already silent at submit time.
- **Staleness guards in `test_results.py`**
  - `latest` prints the age of the results it is showing, and warns loudly when they are more
    than an hour old.
  - Unity's AppData `TestResults.xml` is no longer imported when it is older than 24 hours.
    New `--max-age <hours>` and `--allow-stale` flags on `latest` and `list`.
- **`TestResultVerifierTests`** EditMode suite covering right class, wrong class, empty run,
  partial match, parameterised names, synthetic files, `all` and `category`.

### Fixed
- **A test run could report a different class's results as its own**
  - Symptom: `quick_test.py class B -p play --wait` printed `Status: completed`, echoed
    `Filter: B`, and reported 6 passing tests - which were class A's tests from the previous
    run. Class B never executed.
  - Root cause: the NUnit filter was correct all along
    (`^Namespace\.Class(\.|$)`, escaped and anchored). The failure was in result *attribution* -
    four separate code paths chose which XML belonged to a request using file modification
    time alone, which cannot tell one run's output from another's.
  - All four now verify contents first: `TestExecutor.CheckAndProcessResultFile`,
    `PlayModeTestCompletionChecker.ParseXmlAndUpdateRequest`,
    `TestCoordinatorEditor.TryRecoverFromResultFile`, and the AppData import paths.
  - `RunFinished` additionally checks the in-memory callback results against the filter, which
    catches the case Unity cannot report: a filter resolving to zero tests still produces a
    clean, empty, "successful" run.
- **Entering PlayMode was treated as a crash, causing a duplicate dispatch**
  - Entering play mode always triggers a domain reload, and exiting it triggers another.
    `[InitializeOnLoad]` constructors run *before* `playModeStateChanged(EnteredEditMode)`, so
    `RecoverInterruptedTestRequest` reached the row before `PlayModeTestCompletionChecker` had
    any chance to finish it, and re-queued a live run to `pending`. The request was then
    dispatched a second time and the duplicate could adopt the first run's results.
  - The in-play reload is now recognised and skipped. The exit reload hands off to
    `PlayModeTestCompletionChecker` and only falls back to the interruption ladder if the row
    is still non-terminal 15 seconds later. A genuine editor crash is unaffected - SessionState
    does not survive a restart, so that case was always owned by the 3-minute orphan sweep.
- **An empty result XML no longer reports `completed`**
  - `PlayModeTestCompletionChecker` marked a run with zero test-cases as `completed` with
    `Total: 0`. A run that executed nothing is `inconclusive`.
- **The XML exporter counted every pass twice**
  - `TestFinished` incremented the counters once per finished node - suites included - and then
    `RunFinished` walked the tree and counted the leaves again. An 18-test run exported
    `total="18" passed="44"` with a summary claiming `Pass Rate: 244.4%`, and every path that
    parsed those attributes wrote the inflated numbers into the database.
  - `RunFinished` now resets the counters before its tree walk, which counts leaves only, and
    `TestFinished` no longer stores suite nodes.
- **Three `now - 5 minutes` fallback windows replaced**
  - Used when a dispatch time was unknown, each was wide enough to swallow the previous run's
    results. The dispatch time now falls back through SessionState, `started_at`, `created_at`,
    and finally to "adopt nothing" - not knowing when a run started must not mean accepting
    anything recent.
- **`PerSpec/TestResults` is trimmed instead of emptied**
  - Wiping the directory before every dispatch destroyed the evidence needed to tell runs
    apart, and left the "newer than anything local" heuristic comparing against an empty
    folder - so any AppData XML, however old, looked like the freshest results available.
    The five most recent runs are now kept.
- **`"TestFramework"` is no longer a preferred product name for every project**
  - The AppData scan hard-coded it, ranking an unrelated project's stale results above the
    real ones. Company and product are now read from `ProjectSettings.asset`, and once any
    folder matches this project the scan no longer falls through to folders that do not.
- **`update_system_heartbeat` never wrote anything**
  - The statement used a `?` placeholder with no bindings and an `ON CONFLICT(component)`
    clause on a column with no UNIQUE constraint, and the resulting error was swallowed.
    Rewritten as SELECT-then-UPDATE-or-INSERT.
- **`--wait` no longer accepts any XML when `created_at` cannot be parsed**
  - It now falls back to "written since we started waiting" instead of the newest file on disk.

### Changed
- **`quick_test.py --wait` exit codes are now meaningful**: `0` verified pass, `1` failed or
  timed out, `2` compilation errors, `3` results did not match the requested filter, `4` Unity
  not responding. Scripted callers can no longer read a mismatch as success.
- **The summary prints `Requested filter:` and `Verified:`** side by side. The first is what you
  asked for, the second is what the results actually contain. When they disagree the run is
  reported loudly and the row is corrected to `inconclusive`.
- **Unqualified class filters now surface as `inconclusive` rather than a green pass.** This is
  not a behaviour regression: Unity's anchored `^MyTests(\.|$)` regex never matched
  `Namespace.MyTests.Method`, so those runs were already executing nothing and only appeared to
  pass by adopting another run's file. The error message names the qualified filter to use.
- **`.summary.txt` is no longer preferred over the XML** when both exist. It carries the same
  counts with no test names attached, so it cannot be verified.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-08-07

### Added
- **Dependency preflight that explains a missing package instead of vanishing**
  - Every PerSpec editor assembly depends on `com.gilzoide.sqlite-net`, directly or transitively
    (`Initialization` -> `Services` -> `Coordination` -> `Gilzoide.SqliteNet`). When that package
    fails to resolve, all of them fail to compile, the `Tools > PerSpec` menu disappears, and no
    PerSpec code survives to say why. The user is left with a bare
    `Package [com.gilzoide.sqlite-net@1.3.1] cannot be found` naming a package they never asked for.
  - New `PerSpec.Editor.Preflight` assembly with **zero assembly references**, so it is the one
    that still compiles when the rest of the package cannot. It must stay reference-free.
  - On load it checks every dependency declared in `package.json` using the synchronous
    `PackageInfo.GetAllRegisteredPackages()`. When all are present it logs nothing at all.
  - When one is missing it logs a single error naming the package, what it is needed for, whether
    the package comes from OpenUPM or the Unity registry, and whether `Packages/manifest.json` is
    actually missing the scope or the download simply failed. Gated on `SessionState` so a domain
    reload does not repeat it.
- **`Tools > PerSpec > Repair Package Dependencies`**
  - Registered in the preflight assembly, so it is reachable precisely when the rest of the menu is not.
  - Copies a correct `scopedRegistries` block to the clipboard and offers to reveal
    `manifest.json`. It does not edit the manifest itself: `UnityEditor.PackageManager.Client` has
    no `AddScopedRegistry` in 6000.3, so an automated path would mean hand-merging JSON into the
    one file that gates the entire project, and a bad merge there is far worse than one paste.
  - Reads the manifest as raw text and scans only inside the `scopedRegistries` array, so a package
    id listed under `dependencies` is not mistaken for a scope. No JSON library is used, because
    `com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json` is itself on the list of things that may be missing.

### Fixed
- **Install instructions pointed at a repository that does not exist**
  - `Documentation/quick-start.md` told users to
    `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/perspec.git Packages/com.perspec.framework`.
    Both the URL and the package name were wrong, and the scoped registry went unmentioned, so
    anyone following it landed straight in the resolution failure above.
  - Replaced with the OpenUPM CLI route plus a manual `manifest.json` block listing all three
    required scopes.
- **Package version was hardcoded and had drifted five minor releases**
  - `PerSpecInitializer.cs` carried `private const string CURRENT_VERSION = "1.3.1"` with the
    comment "Should match package.json". It did not: the package was shipping 1.8.x.
  - It was the fallback whenever `PackageInfo.FindForPackageName` returned null, so any failed
    lookup pushed the recorded version backwards to 1.3.1. The next successful lookup then read
    as a fresh upgrade and re-ran the entire update flow: re-copying Python scripts, rewriting LLM
    configuration, and popping the update window for a package that had not changed.
  - Replaced with a resolver that reads the version from the package itself, preferring
    `PackageInfo.FindForAssembly` (which works for registry, embedded and local installs, and does
    not depend on a package-name string staying in sync) and falling back to `FindForPackageName`.
  - When neither can answer, it now reports `unknown` and skips the update check rather than
    inventing a number, since storing a placeholder is what faked the upgrade in the first place.
    The first-run setup window still appears when the project is uninitialized.
- **README recommended a version range Unity does not support**
  - The manual install block used `"com.digitraver.perspec": "^1.5.0"` and claimed the range would
    track 1.5.x and 1.6.x automatically. Unity's project manifest accepts exact versions only;
    npm-style ranges are not supported there. Corrected to an exact version with a note explaining
    the difference.
  - Also documents why all three scopes are required and points at the new repair menu item.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed
- **EditMode tests got stuck and never executed (primary fix)**
  - Symptom: a submitted EditMode request sat at `pending`, or reached `processing`/`executing` and never moved. `quick_test.py --wait` then burned its full 300s timeout with no explanation.
  - Root cause: both background pollers called `CompilationPipeline.RequestScriptCompilation()` in the *same main-thread callback* that had just called `TestRunnerApi.Execute()`. The forced compile triggered a domain reload that destroyed the in-flight `TestExecutor`, its `EditorApplication.update` file monitor and its registered `ICallbacks` — so nothing was left alive to finish the run or write a terminal status. `AssetRefreshCoordinator` removed this same anti-pattern in 1.7.0; the test dispatch path never got the fix.
  - The forced compile is gone from both `BackgroundPoller` and `TestCoordinatorEditor`. The user-invoked `Force Script Compilation` action in the Control Center is unchanged.
- **Duplicate dispatch from three independent pollers** — `TestCoordinatorEditor`'s update loop, its own timer, and `BackgroundPoller` each read `test_requests` and dispatched. `BackgroundPoller.ProcessPendingTestRequest` never checked whether a run was already active, and its `_isProcessing` guard was released when the main-thread callback was *queued* rather than when it completed, so a second dispatch could be queued behind the first. All wake-up sources now funnel through a single guarded `TestCoordinatorEditor.TryDispatchNextRequest()`.
- **Class-level test runs matched zero tests** — `CreateTestFilter` put the class name in `Filter.testNames`, which requires an exact full-name match a class name can never satisfy. Runs "completed" with 0 tests. Class requests now use `Filter.groupNames` with an anchored regex, selecting the class and every method beneath it.
- **`timeout` and `inconclusive` statuses were immediately overwritten** — `OnTestComplete` unconditionally wrote `failed`/`completed` over the precise status `TestExecutor` had just written, so a timed-out run reported `failed` and a skipped-only run reported `completed`. Terminal statuses are now never downgraded.
- **Requests could be stranded at `finalizing` forever** — `RunFinished` set its completion flag and stopped file monitoring *before* saving results, so any exception in between left the row with no remaining path to a terminal state. Result persistence is now isolated so the terminal write always happens, and a late failure marks the request `failed` instead of parking it.
- **Orphan recovery always discarded real results** — `FindAppDataTestResult` probed `LocalAppData\Unity\Editor\TestResults.xml`, but Unity writes to `LocalAppDataLow\{Company}\{Product}\`. Recovery therefore never found results and marked every interrupted run `failed`. All recovery paths now share one candidate-path helper (`TestExecutor.GetAppDataResultCandidatePaths`).
- **TestRunnerApi callbacks leaked between runs** — the file-monitor completion path never called `Cleanup()`, and a later `RunFinished` early-returned before reaching its own cleanup. Stale `TestResultXMLExporter` instances accumulated and wrote extra XML on every subsequent run. The file-monitor and timeout paths now tear down fully.
- **Coordination could be silently disabled for a whole session** — a locked or unreadable database made `SQLiteManager` initialization fail without a word, and both pollers then returned from their static constructors in silence. All three now log a single explicit warning.
- **`EditorPrefs` was read from a ThreadPool thread** in `BackgroundPoller.BackgroundPollCallback`, outside the try block. A throw there killed the timer callback and left the processing flag latched on. The value is now cached from the main thread, and a watchdog releases the flag if a queued main-thread dispatch never runs.
- **`StartedAt` was never set on the real pipeline** — it was stamped only for the `running` status, which the live path never writes (it writes `processing` then `executing`), leaving every duration fallback dead. Now stamped on the first active status, once.
- **`quick_test.py` pre-flight compilation check never worked** — it shelled out to `quick_logs.py`, a script that no longer exists, so it always reported "[OK] No compilation errors" and never blocked a doomed run. It now reads the newest EditMode session log directly via `monitor_editmode_logs`.
- **Maintenance migration v3 could delete live requests** — `DELETE FROM test_requests WHERE created_at < datetime('now','-7 days')` compared INT64 tick values against text. SQLite sorts all integers before all text, so the predicate was unconditionally true for tick-stored rows. The delete is now split by `typeof(created_at)` with a matching tick cutoff.

### Added
- **Compile and play-mode dispatch guards** — a run is never started while Unity is compiling, importing assets, or entering play mode. Blocked requests stay `pending` and dispatch on a later tick, so they self-heal with no user action.
- **Domain-reload persistence and recovery for test runs** — the in-flight request id and dispatch time are stored in `SessionState` (parity with the 1.7.0 refresh work). After a reload, `RecoverInterruptedTestRequest` completes the run from results found on disk, otherwise re-queues it for **one** automatic retry, otherwise marks it `failed`. A request is never left non-terminal.
- **Self-healing `test_requests` CHECK constraint in C#** — mirrors the existing `asset_refresh_requests` repair. A database created by an older Python initializer that rejects `finalizing`/`timeout`/`inconclusive` is rebuilt on editor load, instead of silently freezing rows at their previous status.
- **`quick_test.py stuck [--repair]`** — lists every non-terminal request with its status and age; `--repair` cancels them. Plain `quick_test.py status` now also reports in-flight requests, not just pending ones.
- **Actionable hint while waiting** — if a request is still `pending` after 15 seconds, `--wait` explains the likely causes (unfocused editor, compiling, coordination disabled) instead of staying silent until timeout.
- **`TestExecutor.Abort()`** — tears down a cancelled run's monitor and callbacks so they do not leak into the next run.

### Changed
- **`-p both` submits two separate requests** (EditMode then PlayMode). Unity cannot run both modes in a single `TestRunnerApi.Execute` call; the combined form is now rejected in C# with a clear message instead of silently running nothing.
- **`cancel` covers all non-terminal statuses** — previously only `pending` and `running` could be cancelled, so a request wedged at `processing`/`executing`/`finalizing` (exactly the one needing intervention) could not be cleared from Python.
- **`TestCoordinatorEditor`'s internal polling timer is disabled by default** — `BackgroundPoller` already owns the unfocused-editor wake-up for both tests and refreshes and now funnels into the shared dispatch entry point. The timer code remains and can be re-enabled; only the duplication is gone.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed
- **`CHECK constraint failed` spam on every compilation for databases created before 1.7.0**
  - Symptom: `[SQLiteManager] Error updating status: CHECK constraint failed: status IN ('pending', 'running', 'completed', 'failed', 'cancelled')`, thrown from `AssetRefreshCoordinator.OnCompilationStarted` → `SQLiteManager.UpdateRefreshRequestStatus` whenever the two-phase refresh wrote the new `compiling` status.
  - Root cause: a SQLite CHECK constraint is frozen at `CREATE TABLE` time. A DB file created by a pre-1.7.0 `db_initializer.py` kept the old 5-value `asset_refresh_requests` constraint. The v6 fix migration reached users unreliably — it ran the *synced working-copy* script (stale until a manual `sync_python_scripts.py`), and after any exit-0 run it bumped the package-version EditorPref, suppressing the version-triggered retry for 7 days.
  - **Self-healing repair in C#** — `DatabaseInitializer` now verifies the `asset_refresh_requests` status constraint on every editor load (not just when the DB file is missing) and rebuilds the table to add `compiling` if absent. This is the pure-C# equivalent of Python migration v6 and needs no `python` on PATH and no script sync. The C# `CREATE TABLE` for `asset_refresh_requests` now also carries the full CHECK constraint, so the C# and Python create-paths agree.
  - **Maintenance runner now prefers the package script** — `DatabaseMaintenanceRunner.GetMaintenanceScriptPath()` resolves the always-current package copy of `db_auto_maintenance.py` before the synced working copy, removing the stale-working-copy trap for the Python migration path.

### Added
- **"Initialize / Migrate Database" button in Control Center** — Test Coordinator → Database Maintenance. Creates the DB if missing and upgrades a stale schema on demand (runs the C# self-heal plus the full Python migration sweep). Available even when the database is not yet initialized.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- **Two-phase, compile-aware asset refresh completion**
  - `quick_refresh.py --wait` now blocks until asset import AND any resulting script compilation + domain reload have finished, instead of returning the instant asset import started. When it reports `completed`, Unity is running the new code. This mirrors the v1.6.x work that made `quick_test.py --wait` wait for true completion.
  - New `compiling` refresh status. A request now moves `pending → running → compiling → completed`. `running` means Unity received the request and is importing assets; `compiling` means scripts are recompiling with a domain reload pending; `completed` is only written after the domain reload (or immediately when no compilation was triggered).
  - `AssetRefreshCoordinator` subscribes to `CompilationPipeline.compilationStarted/compilationFinished`. On a successful compile it writes `completed` from the post-domain-reload `[InitializeOnLoad]` recovery pass (`RecoverInterruptedRequests`), so completion is proof the new assemblies are loaded. When compilation finishes with errors (no domain reload occurs), the still-loaded `compilationFinished` handler finalizes the request as `completed` with an `error_message` so the poller never hangs — error triage remains workflow step 3 (`monitor_editmode_logs.py --errors`).
  - Post-reload recovery also rescues requests orphaned in `running`/`compiling` by a domain reload or editor restart (stale `compiling` > 30 min and `running` > 10 min are marked `failed`), fixing a pre-existing bug where an interrupted `running` refresh row was never recovered.
  - Schema migration **v6** adds `compiling` to the `asset_refresh_requests` status CHECK constraint (`db_auto_maintenance.py`), targeting the real `asset_refresh_requests` table. Constraint also updated in `db_initializer.py` and `add_refresh_table.py` for fresh databases.

### Fixed
- **`quick_refresh.py --wait` returning while Unity was still compiling** — the coordinator marked a refresh `completed` as soon as asset import finished (via the `AssetPostprocessor` callback or a 2-frame `delayCall` fallback), before script compilation and domain reload. Callers then checked for compile errors / ran tests against stale, still-compiling state. Completion is now gated on compilation + domain reload.
- **Refresh row deleted mid-flight by `created_at` type-affinity corruption** — `asset_refresh_coordinator.py` inserted `created_at` as ISO **text**, which Unity's sqlite-net coerced to the integer `2026` on the first status `Update`; a maintenance `DELETE ... WHERE created_at < cutoff` during the domain reload then wiped the still-in-flight request (surfacing as `Request N not found`). This is the same corruption fixed for `test_requests` in v1.6.0; `created_at` is now written as .NET INT64 ticks via a `_dotnet_ticks_now()` helper. Before v1.7.0 a refresh completed in ~0.1s so the row was gone before cleanup ran and the bug stayed latent. `print_summary` also now renders tick timestamps as readable dates instead of the raw integer / corrupted `2026`.
- **No-compile refresh could hang until timeout when Unity was unfocused** — the no-change completion path is driven by a bounded `EditorApplication.delayCall` chain (like the original fallback) rather than a wall-clock window, so it still finishes in a few frames when editor `update` ticks stall on an idle/unfocused editor.
- **Orphaned `running` refresh rows never recovered** — a refresh interrupted by a domain reload left its row stuck in `running` forever. `RecoverInterruptedRequests` now reconciles these after each reload.
- **`db_auto_maintenance.py` re-running the newest migration every invocation** — `get_schema_version` ordered by `applied_at` (1-second resolution), so migrations committed in the same second tied and could report an older version. It now uses `MAX(version)`.

### Changed
- Default refresh `--timeout` raised from 60s to **300s** (`quick_refresh.py`, `asset_refresh_coordinator.py`) since a full recompile + domain reload can take minutes. `wait_for_completion` now prints per-phase progress with elapsed time and names the phase it was stuck in on timeout; `print_summary` prints a `[WARNING] Compilation errors detected` line when a `completed` refresh carries an `error_message`.
- Removed the forced `CompilationPipeline.RequestScriptCompilation()` in the background-poll path of `AssetRefreshCoordinator`. It forced a full recompile on every unfocused-Unity refresh; `AssetDatabase.Refresh` already schedules compilation when scripts actually changed, so under the compile-aware semantics the forced compile only added a needless reload.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-05-13

### Documentation
- **architecture.md**: Updated state machine to reflect the fine-grained statuses (`processing`, `executing`, `finalizing`, `timeout`, `inconclusive`) introduced in v1.6.0. Documented the `created_at` storage convention (`.NET DateTime.Now.Ticks` from Python) and the SQLite NUMERIC-affinity corruption it prevents. Rewrote the `TestExecutor` and `PlayModeTestCompletionChecker` flow sections to describe the canonical/fallback completion paths and the `MIN_RUN_SECONDS` / `IsXmlComplete` / write-time-freshness guards. Updated Python `wait_for_completion` example with the v1.6.0 retry + XML-wait semantics.
- **LLM.md**: Replaced the "Understanding Test Status" callout. The previous text described the pre-v1.6.0 behavior where `--wait` only waited for request processing (not actual test execution) and instructed readers to visually verify completion. That guidance is now obsolete and actively misleading — `--wait` now blocks until BOTH the row reaches a terminal status AND the XML is on disk. New text lists the terminal statuses and what each means.

### Notes
- No code changes; documentation-only release so openupm picks up the corrected guidance alongside the v1.6.0 fixes.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- **Root cause of `Request N not found` on `quick_test.py method ... -p play --wait`: created_at storage corruption**
  - Python's `INSERT INTO test_requests` relied on SQLite's `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` default, which stores a TEXT value like `"2026-05-13 01:25:38"`. Unity's sqlite-net layer reads/writes `created_at` as a `DateTime` mapped to INT64 ticks. When sqlite-net's `_connection.Update(entity)` ran on a Python-inserted row (any status update — `processing`, `executing`, `failed`), it triggered SQLite's NUMERIC affinity coercion that turned the TEXT into the integer `2026` (leading digit prefix). The fresh row's `created_at` then satisfied `created_at < ticks_cutoff` for every subsequent cleanup `DELETE FROM test_requests WHERE created_at < ?`, so the row vanished mid-run.
  - Fix: `test_coordinator.py` now writes `created_at` as `.NET DateTime.Now.Ticks` (INT64) via the new `_dotnet_ticks_now()` helper. sqlite-net round-trips the integer without coercion and cleanup comparisons behave correctly. Verified end-to-end against the 7-second `Should_Wait_7_Seconds_Before_Publishing` reproduction: row now transitions `pending → processing → completed`, total=1 passed=1, duration=7.04s.
  - Defense in depth: `TestCoordinatorEditor.RecoverOrphanedRequests` (`TestCoordinatorEditor.cs:92-143`) now re-verifies request age in C# before marking anything `failed`, so even if a future SQL query spuriously returns fresh rows, they won't be flagged as orphaned-by-domain-reload.
- **Premature `completed` status for single-method PlayMode runs (independent issue surfaced during this investigation)**
  - Single-method PlayMode runs could flip to `completed` the instant an AppData `TestResults.xml` was observed, racing the actual test execution.
  - `TestExecutor.cs` no longer marks a request `completed` from the AppData branch of file monitoring. The canonical completion path in `CheckAndProcessResultFile` now also enforces:
    - At least `MIN_RUN_SECONDS` (3s) elapsed since dispatch
    - `IsXmlComplete` (already required for the PerSpec branch) — now applied to the AppData branch too via the regular monitoring loop
    - File write-time newer than `_monitorStartDateTime - 5s` so stale XMLs from a prior run cannot trigger completion
  - The AppData-copy branch in `GetLatestResultFile` now only upgrades `processing → executing` and lets the standard monitoring loop drive completion.
- **Results XML missing from `PerSpec/TestResults/` on the `RunFinished` path**
  - Added `EnsureResultXmlInPerSpec()` invoked from `RunFinished`. If neither the `TestResultXMLExporter` callback nor file monitoring wrote a fresh XML into `PerSpec/TestResults/`, it copies Unity's AppData `TestResults.xml` in before the row is marked `completed`. Guarantees `test_results.py latest` can see the file.
- **Schema CHECK constraint silently rejecting `'inconclusive'` writes**
  - `'inconclusive'` is now in the CHECK list across `db_initializer.py`, `db_update_status_constraint.py`, and `db_auto_maintenance.py`.
  - New migration `apply_migration_v5` in `db_auto_maintenance.py` adds the value to existing databases.
  - `db_update_status_constraint.py` is now idempotent.
- **Python poller aborting on a single missing-row read**
  - `TestCoordinator.wait_for_completion` tolerates up to 10 consecutive `fetchone() == None` reads (≈10s) before raising. Absorbs concurrent cleanup, mid-VACUUM, and other transient invisibilities.
- **`test_results.py latest` and `wait_for_completion` blind to Unity's AppData XML**
  - Both now enumerate Unity's `%LocalAppData%Low/<Company>/<Product>/TestResults.xml` fallback locations and import the file into `PerSpec/TestResults/` if it's newer than anything we already have.

### Changed
- `quick_test.py --wait` now blocks until BOTH the DB row reaches a terminal status AND a matching results XML is on disk in `PerSpec/TestResults/`. Previous behavior returned as soon as the row was processed by Unity (which, due to the race fixed above, often happened before the run actually finished). Help text updated; `test_coordinator.py:wait_for_completion` docstring updated.
- `wait_for_completion` now accepts `xml_grace_seconds` (default 15) and `missing_row_retries` (default 10) parameters for callers who need to tune.
- `CheckAndProcessResultFile` now emits `'inconclusive'` for method-level runs whose entire result set is skipped (previously emitted `'completed'`).

### Added
- `EnsureResultXmlInPerSpec()` helper in `TestExecutor.cs`.
- `_appdata_unity_candidates()` / `_import_appdata_xml_into_perspec()` helpers in `test_results.py`.
- `_await_results_xml()`, `_appdata_low_path()`, `_appdata_unity_dirs()`, `_dotnet_ticks_now()`, `_parse_request_timestamp()` helpers in `test_coordinator.py`.

### Internal
- Fixed long-standing typo in `db_auto_maintenance.py` migration v4: `menu_requests` → `menu_item_requests`. The typo caused v4 to fail with `no such table` on every run, which broke the migration chain so v5 (and any future migrations) could never apply.

### Technical Details
- Minor version bump because `--wait` semantics changed in a way callers can observe (it now blocks for longer in the common case). No public C# API surface changes.
- Re-run `python PerSpec/Coordination/Scripts/db_update_status_constraint.py` after pulling this version to add `'inconclusive'` to existing databases; the migration is idempotent.

## [1.5.20] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Unity Helper — Declarative Scenario Execution**
  - Scenario-based scene and asset automation via JSON task files
  - `ScenarioRunner.cs` EditorWindow for interactive task execution (run, skip, retry, reset)
  - `ScenarioExecutorCoordinator.cs` polls PerSpec's SQLite database for scenario requests
  - `SceneTaskExecutor.cs` with 22 scene/asset/component actions (CreateScene, AddGameObject, SetProperty, InstantiatePrefab, SetTransform, SetRectTransform, SaveAsPrefab, SetListProperty, TakeScreenshot, WaitForGameObject, CallMethod, InspectGameObject, ExportHierarchy, etc.)
  - `LocalizationTaskExecutor.cs` with 17 localization actions (gated by `HAS_UNITY_LOCALIZATION` compile guard via asmdef `versionDefines`)
  - `unityhelper_coordinator.py` Python CLI for submitting scenario requests from terminal
  - Extensible executor registration via `TaskExecutorRegistry`
  - Two-way communication through JSON `status`/`error`/`result` fields
  - Self-verification for all mutation actions (AddGameObject, SetProperty, DeleteGameObject, etc.)
  - New assembly: `PerSpec.Editor.UnityHelper` (Editor-only, with optional localization dependency)

- **Unity Helper Documentation**
  - `Documentation/unity-helper.md` — overview, architecture, quick start, design philosophy
  - `Documentation/unity-helper-tasks.md` — complete action and parameter reference for all 39 actions
  - Added Unity Helper natural language commands and intent mappings to `Documentation/LLM.md`
  - Added Unity Helper links to `Documentation/index.md`

### Technical Details
- Unity Helper code located in `Editor/UnityHelper/` (7 C# files, ~5K LOC)
- Python coordinator at `Editor/Coordination/Scripts/unityhelper_coordinator.py` (373 lines)
- Uses same SQLite coordination pattern as existing PerSpec coordinators
- Localization support conditional via `HAS_UNITY_LOCALIZATION` — defined automatically when `com.unity.localization >= 1.0.0` is installed

## [1.5.19] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed
- **Orphaned Test Requests After Domain Reload**
  - Test requests were getting permanently stuck in "processing" or "executing" status after Unity domain reloads
  - Root cause: Domain reload destroys the `TestExecutor` instance and its file monitoring callbacks
  - New `TestCoordinatorEditor` creates fresh instances on reload, losing track of in-progress tests
  - Added `RecoverOrphanedRequests()` method that runs on initialization to detect and handle stuck requests
  - Requests stuck for more than 3 minutes are automatically recovered or marked as failed
  - Recovery attempts to find and parse test results from Unity's AppData `TestResults.xml`
  - If valid results found, request is marked as completed with accurate test counts
  - If no results found, request is marked as failed with clear error message
  - Recovered result files are copied to `PerSpec/TestResults/` for consistency

### Added
- **GetStuckRequests() Method in SQLiteManager**
  - New method to find requests stuck in active states (processing, executing, running, finalizing)
  - Takes `TimeSpan maxAge` parameter to identify likely orphaned requests
  - Used by recovery logic to detect requests that outlived their monitoring callbacks

### Technical Details
- Recovery runs in static constructor after database initialization
- Checks AppData path: `%LocalAppData%/Unity/Editor/TestResults.xml`
- Validates result file timestamp is after request creation time
- Parses NUnit XML format for test counts (total, passed, failed, skipped) and duration
- Logs all recovery actions for debugging visibility

## [1.5.18] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **Debug Logging for Early Completion Investigation**
  - Added comprehensive `[TestExecutor-FM-DEBUG]` logs to trace early PlayMode test completion
  - Logs when `_monitorStartDateTime` is set and its value
  - Logs all XML files found and their exact timestamps
  - Logs cutoff time calculations for freshness checks
  - Logs whether each file passes/fails the freshness check
  - **Critical**: Logs when completion logic at lines 654-705 triggers
  - Identifies the exact provenance of early completion issues

### Technical Details
- Debug logs use `[TestExecutor-FM-DEBUG]` prefix for easy filtering
- To view logs: `python PerSpec/Coordination/Scripts/monitor_editmode_logs.py --no-limit | grep "FM-DEBUG"`
- Logs cover: StartFileMonitoring(), GetLatestResultFile(), AppData check, completion logic
- Timestamps use ISO 8601 format (`:O` specifier) for precise comparison

## [1.5.17] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed
- **Complete Fix: Early PlayMode Test Result Publishing**
  - Previous fix (v1.5.16) was incomplete because `_currentRequest.StartedAt` is NULL when `GetLatestResultFile()` is called from `StartFileMonitoring()`
  - The request status is only updated to "executing" (which sets `StartedAt`) AFTER file monitoring starts
  - Added new `_monitorStartDateTime` field that captures `DateTime.Now` at the START of `StartFileMonitoring()`
  - All freshness checks now use `_monitorStartDateTime` instead of `_currentRequest.StartedAt`
  - Added freshness filter to `PerSpec/TestResults` directory check (previously had no freshness check at all)
  - Stale result files (written before monitoring started minus 30 seconds buffer) are now correctly skipped
  - Prevents previous run's results from being immediately published when a new test run begins

### Technical Details
- `StartFileMonitoring()` now sets `_monitorStartDateTime = DateTime.Now` before calling `GetLatestResultFile()`
- `GetLatestResultFile()` uses `_monitorStartDateTime` (with 30-second buffer) or falls back to `DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(-5)`
- Both PerSpec/TestResults and AppData file checks now have consistent freshness guards
- The fix ensures tests genuinely run before their results are published

## [1.5.16] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed
- **Root Cause: `TestExecutor` Consuming Stale AppData Results at Startup**
  - `TestExecutor.GetLatestResultFile()` was copying and immediately processing Unity's AppData `TestResults.xml` during `StartFileMonitoring()` — before the current test even entered Play Mode
  - The previous run's AppData file passed no freshness check, so `RequestType == "method"` tests were instantly marked `completed` with the wrong results
  - Added a guard: the AppData file's source `LastWriteTime` must be ≥ `request.StartedAt - 30s`; stale files are skipped with a log message

- **`PlayModeTestCompletionChecker` Stale PerSpec XML Filter**
  - `GetLatestResultFile()` now accepts a `minModifiedTime` parameter and only considers XML files written at or after the current request's `StartedAt` timestamp (minus a 5-second buffer)
  - Prevents old PerSpec TestResults files from satisfying the post-PlayMode completion check

- **False Trigger During Mid-PlayMode Domain Reload**
  - Unity fires `EnteredEditMode` during in-play script recompilation (domain reload), not only on genuine Play Mode exit
  - `OnPlayModeStateChanged` now guards with `!EditorApplication.isPlayingOrWillChangePlaymode` so `CheckForCompletedTests()` is only called on genuine PlayMode exit

### Added
- **Diagnostic Test: `LongRunningPlayModeTest`**
  - `Assets/Tests/PlayMode/LongRunningPlayModeTest.cs` — awaits 7 seconds and asserts `>= 6.5s` elapsed
  - Confirms result publishing only occurs after the test genuinely completes

## [1.5.15] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- **PlayMode Test Results Not Retrieved**
  - Fixed status mismatch preventing PlayMode test results from being captured
  - `GetRunningRequests()` now includes all active test states: `running`, `processing`, `executing`, `finalizing`
  - Previously only checked for `"running"` status, but test execution uses: `pending → processing → executing → finalizing → completed`
  - `PlayModeTestCompletionChecker` now correctly finds active PlayMode tests after domain reload
  - Test results XML files are now properly parsed and database is updated with results

### Technical Details
- Modified `SQLiteManager.GetRunningRequests()` to query for all active states
- Root cause: Test coordinator set status to "processing"/"executing" but completion checker only looked for "running"
- After Unity exits PlayMode, the checker now finds the request and parses the XML results file

## [1.5.14] - 2025-12-04

### Changed
- Version bump for package release

## [1.5.13] - 2025-12-04

### Added
- **Comprehensive Reset System for Control Center**
  - New "Reset" button in Control Center with full system reset capability
  - Stops all coordination services (BackgroundPoller, TestCoordinator, AssetRefresh, MenuItem, SceneHierarchy)
  - Closes database connections with aggressive garbage collection (2.5s wait)
  - Drops and recreates all database tables without deleting the database file
  - Cleans all log directories (EditModeLogs, PlayModeLogs, TestResults, SceneHierarchy)
  - Restarts all coordination services automatically
  - Complete reset in ~5 seconds without Unity restart required
  - Preserves EditorPrefs settings and compiler symbols (PERSPEC_DEBUG, PERSPEC_DOTS_ENABLED)

- **Python Script Enhancement**
  - Added `reset_tables()` function to `db_initializer.py` for safe database reset
  - Keeps database file intact while dropping and recreating all tables
  - New command: `python db_initializer.py reset` (keeps file)
  - Preserved old behavior: `python db_initializer.py reset_full` (deletes file)

### Fixed
- **Database Reset Permission Errors**
  - Fixed "file in use" errors during database reset operations
  - Extended wait time from 1s to 2.5s for database connection cleanup
  - Added multiple garbage collection cycles to ensure connections close
  - Database tables now reset via SQL commands instead of file deletion
  - Prevents Windows "PermissionError: file being used by another process"

### Improved
- **Service Coordination**
  - All coordinators now have public `StopPolling()` and `StartPolling()` methods
  - Better cleanup of background timers and database connections
  - More robust error handling with continue-on-error approach
  - Detailed progress reporting via progress bar (7 steps)

### Technical Details
- ResetService.cs: ~437 lines of comprehensive reset orchestration
- Modified 5 coordinator files with reset support
- Python script updated with table-preserving reset function
- All changes in package location (Packages/com.digitraver.perspec/)

## [1.5.12] - 2025-12-03

### Fixed
- **Windows Unicode Encoding Error in Python Scripts**
  - Fixed UnicodeEncodeError when Python scripts print Unity logs containing emoji characters
  - Windows cmd.exe defaults to cp1252 encoding, which cannot display Unicode emoji like ✅ and ❌
  - Added UTF-8 encoding configuration to all Python coordination scripts
  - Scripts now call `sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding='utf-8', errors='replace')` at startup
  - Prevents crashes when displaying Unity debug logs with Unicode characters

### Technical Details
- Affected 9 scripts: test_playmode_logs.py, test_results.py, quick_test.py, scene_hierarchy.py, quick_clean.py, quick_menu.py, quick_refresh.py, db_migrate.py, editor_log_monitor.py
- monitor_editmode_logs.py already had a similar fix using io.TextIOWrapper
- Uses Python 3.7+ `reconfigure()` method for clean, cross-platform UTF-8 support
- The `errors='replace'` parameter ensures graceful fallback if any character cannot be encoded

## [1.5.11]
- **Some Unity 6 LTS breakage**

## [1.5.10] - 2025-11-26

### Fixed
- **Debug Test Log Levels Button**
  - Fixed TestLogLevels() method to properly demonstrate conditional compilation
  - PerSpecDebug calls now wrapped in #if PERSPEC_DEBUG blocks
  - When debug is disabled, button correctly shows only Unity Debug.Log messages
  - When debug is enabled, button shows both Unity and PerSpecDebug logs
  - Added PerSpec.Runtime.Debug assembly reference to Editor.Services assembly
