**Tired of copy-pasting Unity errors into your LLM? Frustrated with the endless cycle of switching back to the editor just to click "Run"?**

PerSpec bridges the gap between your terminal and the Unity Editor, giving you powerful command-line control over your development workflow. Stop the context switching. Start building faster.

## What is PerSpec?

PerSpec is a lightweight, rock-solid toolkit that connects your terminal to the Unity Editor using a simple but powerful combination of Python scripts and a local SQLite database. It allows you to **refresh assets, check for errors, run tests, and view logs** without ever leaving your command line.

It's designed for modern, test-driven development and is perfect for solo developers, teams, and even for coordinating with AI coding assistants.

## Quick Start

1. **Install via OpenUPM (Recommended):**
    * Install the OpenUPM CLI if you haven't already:
      ```bash
      npm install -g openupm-cli
      ```
    * Add PerSpec to your project:
      ```bash
      openupm add com.digitraver.perspec
      ```
    * Or visit [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/packages/com.digitraver.perspec/) for alternative installation methods.

    <details>
    <summary><b>Manual Installation (Alternative)</b></summary>

    If you prefer to manually edit your `Packages/manifest.json`, add the following. **All three scopes are required** for dependency resolution:

    ```json
    "scopedRegistries": [
      {
        "name": "OpenUPM",
        "url": "https://package.openupm.com",
        "scopes": [
          "com.digitraver.perspec",
          "com.cysharp.unitask",
          "com.gilzoide.sqlite-net"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "dependencies": {
      "com.digitraver.perspec": "1.5.6"
    }
    ```
    </details>

2. **Initialize PerSpec in Unity:**
    * Once the package is installed, go to `Tools > PerSpec > Initialize PerSpec`.
    * This creates the `PerSpec/` directory in your project root, which contains the coordination database and Python scripts.

3. **Open the Control Center:**
    * Go to `Tools > PerSpec > Control Center` to access all PerSpec features through a user-friendly interface.

You're all set! You can now control Unity from the Control Center.

## Command Reference

Here are the key actions available through the **Control Center** (`Tools > PerSpec > Control Center`):

### Unity Interaction

| Action | Description | Control Center Location |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Refresh Assets** | Triggers Unity to re-import and compile your code | Debug Settings > Force Compilation |
| **Save Project** | Saves the current scene and project changes | Use Unity's File menu directly |
| **Open Console** | Opens the Unity Console window | Use Unity's Window menu directly |

### Viewing Logs

| Action | Description | Control Center Location |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| **View Compilation Errors** | Displays C# compilation errors from the editor | Test Coordinator > Test Status |
| **View Recent Logs** | Shows recent log entries from the current session | Test Coordinator > Status Display |
| **Database Statistics** | Shows database size and maintenance status | Test Coordinator > Database Status |

### Running Tests & Viewing Results

| Action | Description | Control Center Location |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Run EditMode Tests** | Executes all EditMode tests in your project | Test Coordinator (auto-polling enabled) |
| **Run PlayMode Tests** | Executes all PlayMode tests in your project | Test Coordinator (auto-polling enabled) |
| **View Test Results** | Shows a summary of the latest test run | Test Coordinator > Test Status |
| **Cancel Running Test** | Cancels the currently executing test | Test Coordinator > Cancel Current Test |

### Maintenance

| Action | Description | Control Center Location |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Quick Cleanup** | Clears old logs and compacts the database | Test Coordinator > Clean Old Data (2h) |
| **Vacuum Database** | Optimizes database performance | Test Coordinator > Vacuum Database |
| **Aggressive Cleanup** | Deep clean for databases over 10MB | Test Coordinator > Aggressive Cleanup |
| **Reset Database** | Complete database reset | Test Coordinator > Reset Database |

### Advanced Features (Command Line)

For advanced users and AI/LLM integration, PerSpec also provides Python scripts for programmatic control. See the [AI/LLM Integration Guide](Documentation/LLM.md) for details on command-line usage.

## The Recommended TDD Workflow

PerSpec is built for a fast, iterative Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow. Follow this cycle for maximum efficiency and confidence.

> **Note:** When working with AI assistants like Claude Code, steps 2-4 can be automated with natural language prompts. See [Automating with LLM Prompts](#automating-with-llm-prompts) below.

#### **Step 1: Write Your Code & Tests**
Create your feature and a corresponding test file in your IDE.

#### **Step 2: Refresh Unity**
Tell Unity to import the new files and get ready for compilation.
* **Manual:** Open **Control Center > Debug Settings** and click **Force Compilation**
* **LLM Prompt:** Say **"refresh Unity"**

#### **Step 3: Check for Compilation Errors**
Before you run any tests, make sure your code actually compiles!
* **Manual:** Check **Control Center > Test Coordinator** for the current status
* **LLM Prompt:** Say **"show errors"** or **"get errors"**
* Any C# errors will be displayed in the Test Status section

> **Pro Tip:** If you see errors, fix them and go back to Step 2. Don't run tests if your code doesn't compile!

#### **Step 4: Run Your Tests**
Execute your test suite and see the results.
* **Manual:** The **Test Coordinator** with auto-polling enabled will automatically pick up and run pending tests
* **LLM Prompt:** Say **"run tests"**
* View results in the **Test Status** section

Rinse and repeat! This simple loop ensures you're always working with a stable, tested codebase.

### Automating with LLM Prompts

When working with an LLM assistant (like Claude Code), you can automate the TDD workflow with natural language commands:

| Step | Manual Action | LLM Prompt | What It Does |
|------|---------------|------------|--------------|
| **2** | Control Center > Force Compilation | `"refresh Unity"` | Runs `quick_refresh.py full --wait` to reimport assets and compile |
| **3** | Control Center > Test Status | `"show errors"` or `"get errors"` | Runs `monitor_editmode_logs.py --errors` to display compilation errors |
| **4** | Control Center > Test Coordinator | `"run tests"` | Runs `quick_test.py all -p edit --wait` to execute test suite |

**Automatic Workflow:** Capable LLMs will automatically run steps 2-3 after writing or modifying any C# code to verify compilation before considering the task complete.

For complete command-line documentation and advanced usage, see the [AI/LLM Integration Guide](Documentation/LLM.md).

## For Power Users & AI Integration

PerSpec was originally built to help guide LLM assistants like Claude and Gemini. The robust command-line interface is perfect for programmatic use. If you want to dive deeper into the architecture or integrate PerSpec with an AI, check out the detailed documentation:
